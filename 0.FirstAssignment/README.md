This work must be pushed by next Sunday, for Monday's. 

1) Using R read the CSV file for red and white wine. 

Let us look at the this data with two viewpoints: one ignoring the label 'quality' and one using it. 

A first question we might wish to know is if the vector of features describing the wines are descriptive at all. A way to try to see this is by attempting an 'unsupervised' method of clustering, trying to group the wines into natural groupings, and demonstrating with plots that there are some natural clusters. Our first chapter speaks of K nearest neigbor methods that may be useful. YOU WILL NEED TO ACTIVELY EXPLORE THIS OPEN ENDED QUESTION. 

A second question is whether there is a natural functional relationship between the wine features and the quality of the wine (or whether wine quality is just a fraud). 

Here you want to plot quality as a function of the other attributes to see if there is in fact some objective function that could predict quality.  Again a plot is essential. 

Explore the two questions above and push your answers in two reporst in pdf files. These MUST be named UNSUP.pdf and SUP.pdf.

2) Answer the questions that I put in your email today. 
I) My neighbor has two children. Assuming that the gender of a child is like a coin flip, it is most likely, a priori, that my neighbor has one boy and one girl, with probability 1/2. The other possibilities—two boys or two girls—have probabilities 1/4 and 1/4.
a. Suppose I ask him whether he has any boys, and he says yes. What is the probability that one child is a girl?
b. Suppose instead that I happen to see one of his children run by, and it is a boy. What is the probability that the other child is a girl?

II) Suppose a crime has been committed. Blood is found at the scene for which there is
no innocent explanation. It is of a type which is present in 1% of the population.
a. The prosecutor claims: There is a 1% chance that the defendant would have the crime blood type if he
were innocent. Thus there is a 99% chance that he guilty. This is known as the prosecutor's fallacy.
What is wrong with this argument?

b. The defender claims: The crime occurred in a city of 800,000 people. The blood type would be
found in approximately 8000 people. The evidence has provided a probability of just 1 in 8000 that
the defendant is guilty, and thus has no relevance.ât all.This is known as the defender's fallacy. What is
wrong with this argument?
